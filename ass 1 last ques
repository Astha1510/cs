Enter some integers from the user. If the integer is not present in the array, then continue,
else add the address of that integer to a new array of pointers. Then, print this array of pointers,
as well all the values inputted by the user that is present in array A.


#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int i;
int a[]={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,91,8,9}
int(*p)[10];
int n;
for(i = 0;i<n;i++)
  {
    printf("\n Enter a number");
    scanf("%d",&n);
for(int j = 0 ;j<10;j++)
{
  if(n==a[j])
    {
      p = &a[i];
      printf("the element is present in an array %d address %d value %d",j,p,a[j]);
    }
  }
}
}
