5. Take two inputs (integers) from user and using pointers p1 & p2, find the number of elements
present between these two entries.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
 int x,y;
printf("\n Enter the number1");
scanf("%d",&x);
printf("\n Enter the number2");
scanf("%d",&y);
int *p = &x;
 int *q = &y;


 int i = *p;
while(i<*q)
{
printf("\n No between x and y are %d",i);
i++;
}
}
